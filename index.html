  <h1>LINKIN PARK</h1>
  <img src='img/park.png' alt=''>
  <p>Linkin Park is performing a set from 
their roots when getting into the music
industry from albums like Hybrid Theory
to Hunting Party. They will be lighting
up the stage with Chester and Mike
paving the way as the final act of the 
event for Warp Tour. 

After their latest album drop of 2017,
One More Light they will be providing the 
audience with a jam packed nu-metal 
performance to the diverse lineup of 
artists.

Chester with the rest of the band 
have received much criticism for 
their latest album release, they're 
taking this feedback as fuel to dig 
deep and give a performance that 
will rock the crowd to their core, 
after much time of being cooped 
up in the house, like many of us 
have been they have crafted a 
performance that will go down in
music history.</p>

  <p>Green Day is bringing an a chaos fueled
performance to the big stage with hits

They have been gone for a while since the 90s but hope to

  <p>The "Teurs" are coming to the Tour! With their low impact notes that
give a lot of emotion in songs like Steady as She Goes and Consolers
of the Lonely we feel these guitar rifts unlike anything in Alternative 
music history. Jamming out with every note strung, we cannot wait 
to see what they have in store for the Warp Tour goers. We are 
anticipating a great show that will bring the crowd to their feet!</p>

  <h1>MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE</h1>
  <img src='img/mcr.png' alt=''>
  <p>When I was a young boy, my father took me to see Warp Tour! The band
who conquered the early 2000s and made every emo persons voice heard. 
MCR is back and after reuniting once more to celebrate new album releases in 
Fall 2020, they are looking to bring the Black Parade back to reality in making 
sure that that Helena doesn't die and making sure everyone in the crowd 
sings it for the boys and sings it for the girls, sings it so loud the whole world 
hears your voice. 

The band had been broken up for the past few years and the members went 
on their own ways doing their own things for a while. Lead singer _________ 
had been making comic book in his spare time but always continue conducting 
music and writing it since.
